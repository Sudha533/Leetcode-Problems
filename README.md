<p>	Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it. A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string. </p>

<li>Example 1: Input: s = "abc" Output: 3 Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c". </li>
<li>Example 2: Input: s = "aaa" Output: 6 Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".</li>
<ul>

<b><u>Explanation:</u></b>
The problem is asking us to count how many palindromic words and group of letters are in a given string. Lets use a technique called “expand aound center” to find palindromic substrings efficiently.
<b><u>Bruteforce approach</u></b>
<b><u>Expand around center technique (Optimized approach)</u></b>
